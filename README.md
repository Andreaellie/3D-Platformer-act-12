Easy to use:

```GDScript
extends Sprite2D

@export var speed : float = 100

@export var joystick_left : VirtualJoystick

@export var joystick_right : VirtualJoystick

var move_vector := Vector2.ZERO

func _process(delta: float) -> void:
	## Movement using the joystick output:
#	if joystick_left and joystick_left.is_pressed:
#		position += joystick_left.output * speed * delta

	## Movement using Input functions:
	move_vector = Vector2.ZERO
	move_vector = Input.get_vector("ui_left","ui_right","ui_up","ui_down")
	position += move_vector * speed * delta

	# Rotation:
	if joystick_right and joystick_right.is_pressed:
		rotation = joystick_right.output.angle()
```


## OPTIONS:

- Joystick mode:
	- Fixed: The joystick doesn't move.
	- Dynamic: Every time the joystick area is pressed, the joystick position is set on the touched position.
	- Following: When the finger moves outside the joystick area, the joystick will follow it.

- Dead zone size: If the tip is inside this range the output is zero.

- Clamp zone size: The max distance the tip can reach.

- Visibility mode:
	- always: Always visible.
	- touchscreen only: Visible on touch screens only (will hide if the device has not a touchscreen).
	- when_touched: Visible only when touched.

- Use input actions: if true the joystick will trigger the input actions created in Project -> Project Settings -> Input Map

## HELP:
- The Control parent of the joystick is the area in which the joystick can move in Dynamic mode.
- For moving the joystick inside his area, select it, right click, turn on "Editable Children" and then change the position of the Base node.
- With "Editable Children" turned on you can also edit the joystick textures and colors.
- Create a CanvasLayer node and name it "UI", it'll contain all the UI elements, then add the Joystick scene as a child of the UI node and move it where you prefer.
- An example scene is provided in the "Test" folder.

## FAQ
### Multitouch doesn't work / can't use two joystick at the same time:
In Godot, the input events from the mouse don't support multitouch, so make sure to have this configuration:  
Project -> Project Settings -> General -> Input Devices  
"emulate touch from mouse" ON  
"emulate mouse from touch" OFF  

### The joystick doesn't work when using Input.get_vector():
âš  **This has been fixed in Godot Engine!**  
Unfortunately, this a bug in the Godot engine, so the only solution for now is using Input.get_axis:  
This doesn't work:
```gdscript
input_vector := Input.get_vector("ui_left","ui_right","ui_up","ui_down")
```  
This works:
```gdscript
input_vector := Vector2.ZERO
input_vector.x = Input.get_axis("ui_left", "ui_right")
input_vector.y = Input.get_axis("ui_up", "ui_down")
```
